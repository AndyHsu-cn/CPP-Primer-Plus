 *  You sell the book C++ for Fools.Write a program that has you enter a yearâ€™s worth
 *  of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money).The program should
 *  use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of
 *  string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input
 *  data in an array of int.Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents
 *  and report the total sales for the year.
